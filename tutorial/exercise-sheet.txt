In the next few exercises neural networks (NN) will be trained. 
This neural networks should allow to separate ttH(bb) events from ttbb events.
Hereby, only events which contain at least 6 jets and among them 4 b-tagged b-jets.

=========
Exercise 1
=========

- Open the exercise file exercise1.py and try to understand the code.
- Execute the script.
- Have a look on the produced plots.


=========
Exercise 2
=========

- Open the file exercise2.py and try to understand the code.
- Invoke the exercis2.py script a few times and apply different values for the parameter "keep_prob" (value range from 0.1 to 0.9).
- How does the "AUC Training Score" develop? Compare each of the "AUC Training Scores" with their corresponding "AUC Validation Scores".
- Choose a value of 0.5 for the parameter "keep_prob" and invoke the script a few times with different values for the parameter "beta" aus 
(value range 1e-10 bis 1e-5).
- How does the "AUC Training Score" change?  
Compare the "AUC Training Score" again with the "AUC Validation Score".


=========
Exercise 3
=========

- Open the file exercise3X.py files and try to understand the code.
- Execute all four scripts.
- The scripts make use of 4 different data sets.
What could be the difference between the 4 data sets?

====================
Hint for  exercise 3
====================

- Have a look into the file "sum_of_weights_sorted.txt" for each of the four NNs.
- Here, for all input variable the absoulute value for each supplied input variable is stored.
